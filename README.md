# Night on the Town

## Description

Night on the town is a website that allows the user to enter any city available to the Ticketmaster API and receive information about the most recent upcoming events in that area. When entered, the page will be populated with multiple cards displaying each events name, the venue it is located at, the date of the event and the time it occurs. Clicking on this link will take you to the respective Ticketmaster site to purchase the tickets for the event. Under each event card is a link that takes you to a separate page powered by Yelp to display restaurants and bars within the local area the event is taking place.
